Updated:
There is an Option to attach a height and lenght modifiable extra box to the back creating an extra lid aswell. 
The dividers can be set to be either even (and only in the Primary box) or with custom distances which will be able to go into the extra box and change height accordingly (on the Y-Dividers only).

For coders:
Something that could be added is X-Dividers also changing height and make them go into the extra box and possibly a function to cut the box and lid in half to accomodate smaller Printers so cutting doesnÂ´t need to be done on the printer Software.
